In the first and second year of my studies, I have acquired a wealth of knowledge. The continuous
exposure to new concepts and technologies has been truly astonishing. Throughout this period, I have
delved into multiple programming languages such as Java (for Android development), C#, JavaScript, and
TypeScript. Additionally, I have gained proficiency in utilizing frameworks like Entity Framework (EF) for
C#, NestJS, and Mongoose for MongoDB.
Moreover, I have pursued courses focused on enhancing user experience (UX), honing my skills in
professional writing and communication in both Dutch and English. These courses have equipped me with the
necessary tools to effectively convey ideas and information.
Throughout various projects of varying durations, I have had the opportunity to work with different
project management methodologies such as Waterfall, Agile Scrum, and Kanban. This diverse range of
experiences has enabled me to develop leadership skills, learn how to collaborate within a team, as well
as thrive independently.
These accumulated experiences have shaped me into a versatile professional capable of working across every
layer of the technology stack, adapting to the needs of any given situation.
