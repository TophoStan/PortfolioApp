        <p>My name is Stan Tophoven, an enthusiastic 18-year-old boy with a passion for traveling, sports, and creating
          software that can make the world a better place.</p>
        <p>
          I have always been fascinated by the power of technology and the possibilities it offers to bring about
          positive change. As a traveler, I have had the opportunity to experience different cultures and societies, and
          it has made me realize that there are many problems that need to be addressed. I strongly believe in the power
          of software to provide solutions to these challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a volleyball player and fitness enthusiast, I am accustomed to working in teams and am driven to constantly
          improve myself. I would like to apply these qualities in a role where I can work with others to develop
          innovative software solutions. I am determined to use my technical skills and mindset to contribute to a
          better world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a passion for programming. I have successfully learned various programming languages and am proficient
          in developing software applications. Additionally, I have gained experience in project management and
          collaboration during my studies.

        description="In the first and second year of my studies, I have acquired a wealth of knowledge. The continuous
        exposure to new concepts and technologies has been truly astonishing. Throughout this period, I have
        delved into multiple programming languages such as Java (for Android development), C#, JavaScript, and
        TypeScript. Additionally, I have gained proficiency in utilizing frameworks like Entity Framework (EF) for
        C#, NestJS, and Mongoose for MongoDB.
        Moreover, I have pursued courses focused on enhancing user experience (UX), honing my skills in
        professional writing and communication in both Dutch and English. These courses have equipped me with the
        necessary tools to effectively convey ideas and information.
        Throughout various projects of varying durations, I have had the opportunity to work with different
        project management methodologies such as Waterfall, Agile Scrum, and Kanban. This diverse range of
        experiences has enabled me to develop leadership skills, learn how to collaborate within a team, as well
        as thrive independently.
        These accumulated experiences have shaped me into a versatile professional capable of working across every
        layer of the technology stack, adapting to the needs of any given situation."
